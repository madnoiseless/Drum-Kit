# Drum Kit: An Interactive Online Drum Set

Drum Kit is a fun, interactive web-based application that allows you to play a virtual drum set using your keyboard or by clicking on the drum buttons. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

2. Use your keyboard to press the corresponding keys (w, a, s, d, j, k, l) to play the drums.
3. Alternatively, click on the drum buttons displayed on the webpage.
4. Each key or button will play a unique drum sound.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the webpage and creating the layout.
